    <h2>augmented card game:</h2>

    <img src="images/ar_card_game.png" alt="AR card game" style="max-width: 100%;" />

    <p>
      I created an augmented reality card game support for Adventure Time Card Wars, bringing the holographic battles from the cartoon into real life. 
      In the show, Finn and Jake play cards that summon characters to fight, which makes it a perfect fit for AR. 
      The app is developed in Unity using ARFoundation and supports both Android and iOS. 
      It uses ARTrackedImageManager to recognise unique cards, ARPlaneManager to detect horizontal surfaces, and also detects user actions like card rotation. 
      I also added some simple animations using animators and blend trees to make the experience more engaging. 
      As a prototype, it shows how the card game can be made more interactive and imaginative through AR.

    <h2>research: <br>Impact of Avatar Clothing on Purchasing Decisions</h2>

    <img src="images/avatar.png" alt="Avatar Clothing Study" style="max-width: 100%;" />

    <p>
      Researched into whether avatar clothing influences user shopping
      behaviour in immersive virtual environments. To explore this, we developed a virtual reality retail
      store using Unity, created avatars with different clothing styles using Ready Player Me, integrated movements and inverse kinematics using FinalIK, 
      and conducted an experiment using Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3. We collected data on gaze dwelling time, expenditure, and embodiment through interaction
      logs and questionnaires.
